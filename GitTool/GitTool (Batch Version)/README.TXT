1. Place the "GIT BAT TOOLS" folder into the root "git-repo" folder containing the main "studio" folder.

2. Run the "Tool Interface" batch file.

If the folder has been placed correctly the program should run as expected, type help for commands.
If auto-setup fails it is likely you have placed the folder in the wrong location.
